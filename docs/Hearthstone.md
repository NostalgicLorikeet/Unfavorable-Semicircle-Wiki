# Hearthstone 

Hearthstone is a 2014 online collectible card game by Blizzard Entertainment. In February 2023, investigation of [audio composites](audio_composites "wikilink") revealed that the game's icon, a stylized compass was contained within [♐LOCK](LOCK "wikilink")'s audio data, which Discord user `Piecat` then identified as being from Hearthstone through a reverse-image-search on Google.

Discord user `ShinyQuagsire` has pin-pointed the 2015 IOS icon to be the exact version used, which was likely to be the current one at the time ♐LOCK was uploaded:

Since this discovery, many similarities between the game and UFSC have been found, including:

* A card named Spell Lock.
* [Brill](BRILL "wikilink") is the name of an in-universe town.
* A card named Star Aligner whose flavor text mentions Sagittarius.
* Christie [Golden](GOLDEN "wikilink") wrote novels for World of Warcraft, which is in the same fictional universe as Hearthstone.
* A card named [Freebird](MAX_TEND "wikilink").
* In the MMORPG World of Warcraft, also by Blizzard Entertainment the hearthstone core item can be used to transport the player from anywhere in the game world to their user-set "home location". "Homesick" was a song featured in [♐DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") - with a possible thematic connection between LOCK with DELOCK and being-home (or returning-home) with being-homesick.
