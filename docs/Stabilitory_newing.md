## Possible significance of name

Anagrams of "stabilitory newing":

  - "initial bytes wrong"
  - "login is betray twin"
      - "Twin" could be a reference to the zodiac sign Gemini, which is
        the opposite sign to Sagittarius ('Betrayed by the Twins?')

## Work on finding information in the visuals

Earlier work focused on [treating the "histograms" as a source of data](Investigation_into_color_data_in_SN_visuals "wikilink"). Interest was renewed after the June 2022 ♐️[ANSWERS](ANSWERS "wikilink") tweet specifically said that "yes, there are Stabilitory Newing composites".

## Removal

The Twitter account was deleted (apparently by the author(s)
[Unfavorable Semicircle](Unfavorable_Semicircle "wikilink") itself) at
the time ♐[RESET\_STRANGE\_YD](RESET_STRANGE_YD "wikilink") was
uploaded.
