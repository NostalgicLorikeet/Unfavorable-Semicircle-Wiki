# MAX TEND

♐MAX\_TEND is a video posted to the second youtube account on July 14, 2016. Its name is ambiguously related to [a post](https://plus.google.com/100522957117354193465/posts/KJUyUJ3xtV4) with the same words on the original account's G+ page.

On 2016-09-23 it was renamed to ♐MAX\_TEND MALFORM. (The day before, a message with the same phrase appeared on the Google plus page). It appears the name was changed around the same time ♐[RECOVER](RECOVER "wikilink") was posted.

## Meaning of "FREEBIRD3"

The password-like "FREEBIRD3" is similar to the spelled-out "I AM NOT H" near the beginning of [DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink").
