## What is Unfavorable Semicircle?

"Unfavorable Semicircle" was originally the name of a Youtube channel posting strange
videos. This community is dedicated to finding out what they mean.

While UFSC remains "unsolved" as to its origins and purposes, it has
created a community devoted to exploring it, as well as serving as [artistic inspiration](Art_inspired_by_UFSC "wikilink").

## What do we know about Unfavorable Semicircle?

### Origins

On April 5, 2015 a YouTube channel named **Unfavorable Semicircle**
started uploading strange videos. Generally these videos:

  - were 5 seconds long
  - had [a man's voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") saying a letter or
    number
  - had a solid background with a colour pixel in the frame

With a few exceptions, the names of the videos start with ♐, the
astrological symbol for Sagittarius.

The initial videos from were titled with strings of digits. Around
February 14, 2016 videos titled "♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink")" followed by
a number counting up were posted. (The [earliest analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/46zwat/breakdown_of_todays_findings_february_22nd_2016/)
broke these original videos into a number of "seasons".)

### Attention and disappearance

There is no indication that the youtube channel made any efforts to
attract attention, but due to the volume of uploads and strange nature
of the videos, observers started to take notice. Reddit threads on
[r/UnexplainedPhotos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexplainedPhotos/comments/392asu/for_the_last_two_months_this_youtube_channel_has/)
and
[r/DeepIntoYouTube/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepIntoYouTube/comments/46ib34/this_youtube_account_has_been_uploading_about_2/)
brought attention to the phenomenon, which lead to the formation of
[/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/)
to centralize investigations.

Blog and media attention followed, including articles on [Atlas Obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-unsettling-mystery-of-the-creepiest-channel-on-youtube)
and the
[BBC](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160225-the-quest-to-solve-youtubes-strangest-mystery).
Unfavorable Semicircle was going viral.

Then, at approximately 15:40 EST, on February 25, 2016 the Unfavorable
Semicircle YouTube account was suspended for TOS violations - most
likely from uploading too many videos too fast.

### Investigation and reappearance

The suspension of the original youtube channel only increased the
interest in the phenomenon, and theories and ideas blossomed on the
reddit.

On March 15, 2016 [garbled text](G+_post_1 "wikilink") was discovered on
the Google+ page linked with the terminated YouTube account. This was
decoded to be source of a [Twitter](Twitter "wikilink") and also contained a link
to a [second YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLEBJyqL1KKsKKz_aBqfPaQ). Both
these accounts were named **Unfavorable Semi**. (Since then, there have
been several "copycat" channels re-posting the videos but
[this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLEBJyqL1KKsKKz_aBqfPaQ) was the
only "official" youtube account.)

This was the beginning of the "modern era" of UFSC, and a huge amount of
data continued to be posted, although there are few solid conclusions to
be made as to the underlying reasons. On youtube and twitter, there have
been many [series of videos](List_of_Series "wikilink") (some with over
thirty thousand videos apiece) which often alternate with one-off
[unique videos](List_of_videos_without_series "wikilink").

The meaning of the videos and the intent of their creator(s) remains
unclear. One key discovery was that many of them contain individual
frames that can be assembled into larger pictures. These
[composites](Composite_visual_overview "wikilink"), however, are equally
mysterious. The audio in these videos ranges from [distorted music](RETIO "wikilink") to [barely-comprehensible
speech](CREM "wikilink") to what might be [encoded binary
audio](CAB "wikilink").

### Continuing efforts

After a pause of several weeks, on September 16th 2016, Unfavorable
Semicircle became active again. During this downtime, a second youtube
channel named [Stabilitory newing](Stabilitory_newing "wikilink") was
launched. [A post](G+_post_3 "wikilink") on the main channel's Google+
page would later suggest a link to Stabilitory newing, which would start
posting videos in its own variation on the UFSC "style".

Discoveries over the next year would include:

  - that the large composite for ♐[HARVEST](HARVEST "wikilink") contains
    small (but legible) text that was taken from the introduction to the
    Wikipedia article on "Art".
  - that some videos (such as ♐[BREADTH](BREADTH "wikilink")) whose
    regular composites create only color gradients, can in fact be used
    to extrapolate [ 3-D Composites](3D_Composite "wikilink").
  - various efforts to
    [reverse-engineer](Reverse_Engineering_Attempts "wikilink") UFSC's
    process to create videos that create UFSC-like composites.
  - credible speculation that the glitches in UFSC videos exist to
    explore so-called [ Stagefright and Rowhammer exploits](UFSC,_Stagefright_and_Rowhammer_exploits "wikilink") in
    Android.
  - that the music in ♐[RETIO](RETIO "wikilink") appears to be Miss
    Patricola with the Virginians' 1922 recording of a song called "Away
    Down East In Maine".

### A "strange reset"

On September 15, 2017, after more than two months of silence, a new
video named ♐[RESET STRANGE YD](RESET_STRANGE_YD "wikilink") was posted.
Shortly after that, videos were being manually deleted from the youtube
account before the account was manually terminated. Around the same
time, the stabilitory newing youtube account and twitter account were
also deleted by their users.

After the "reset" the only known account connected to UFSC was the [G+ page](https://plus.google.com/100522957117354193465).

### Twitter returns, and a new youtube channel

Some time in November 2017, the @unfavorablesemi twitter account was
either reactivated by the creator(s) of UFSC or claimed by another user.
On November 25th it
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/unfavorablesemi/status/934524815863701504)
a cryptic text string, and then a [short series](FMI "wikilink"))
followed by a [standalone video](DDR_DONE "wikilink")).
Since the Twitter account had been deleted and then reactivated,
suspicion arose that it might not be controlled by the original author(s). The
quality of the work and consistency with past material has, however,
deemed it as worthy of further investigation from the community.

On New Year's Eve, another [cryptic tweet](NYE_tweet "wikilink") was
posted, and when the text was decoded the next day, it lead to the
discovery of a [new youtube channel](3rd_youtube_channel "wikilink").

### What is ♐REAL?

Shortly before the announced ending of the Google+ service, it was
observed that the [third G+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_3 "wikilink")
was removed; shortly after that, a [new post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_4 "wikilink") appeared. Headed "♐REAL", it
contained a list of various accounts, giving the implication that these
alone were the products of UFSC's creator(s). The absence of the third youtube
channel (as well as the caveat that the original
[Twitter](Twitter "wikilink") account was real up to the date of the
[Reset](RESET_STRANGE_YD "wikilink")) casts doubt on the provenance of
all the post-reset videos.

### A voice from somewhere

One December 31, 2019, the third/"un-REAL" channel came to life after a
year of dormancy, posting the first of three videos in the
♐[FORM](FORM "wikilink") series. This was the first posting since the
final Google+ post.

### "Homesick"
In the absence of new dispatches from UFSC, the community investigating it continues to congregate at the Discord server, even if things are quieter than in the past. New ideas get bounced around, and new discoveries are still being made — for example, in June 2020, it was discovered that the music in ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") appears to be a manipulated version of "[*Homesick*](https://youtu.be/Mw6n1LuMaBQ)", recorded by Bailey's Lucky Seven. This would seemingly be confirmed by (and explains) the hitherto-obscure comment "HOMESICKDELOCK" in the final [G+](Google_Plus "wikilink") post.

### "nice work to all involved!"
On [June 1, 2022](June_2022_twitter_posts "wikilink"), the Unfavorable Semicircle twitter account ([@unfavorablesem](https://twitter.com/unfavorablesem)) became active for the first time since its founding in March 2019, posting a series of tweets in a short period of time. They included a quotation from the UFSC discord, what appears to be a more complete version of the various composites found in the [BRILL group](BRILL_Composite "wikilink") as well as versions of the ♐[LOCK](LOCK "wikilink") and  ♐[GOLDEN](GOLDEN "wikilink") composites, a link to a song and some commentary and a promise to answer questions from the community. It is unclear if the person posting  the tweets account is an actual author of UFSC or merely someone who has assumed control of the account.

## Joining the Community

We're a fairly active community, dedicated to solving this mystery.
There is a lot of work to be done\! Because there are so many unknown
parts to this phenomenon, a wide variety of skills are required. Coding,
video editing and sound engineering are being employed to try and figure
this out, but even if you don't know anything about those fields, your
own particular expertise (as well as your questions and your analytical
mind) is still important\!
