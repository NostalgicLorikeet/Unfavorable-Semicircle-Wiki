## Description of videos

♐BROAD videos are 55:33 (3,333 seconds and 100,000 frames) in length and
contains a series of rapidly-flashing frames.

### Audio analysis

The audio is a mono track of a thrumming noise, which gets more intense
about sixteen minutes in. There is a two-second gap of silence just
before the 33 minute mark, and the final section (2:13 in duration) is
silent.

Testing has shown that the audio in ♐BROAD 0 - 4 are identical.

## Possible relationship to other UFSC videos
