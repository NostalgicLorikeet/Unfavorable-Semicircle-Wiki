## Description of video

At 9:43:20 (35000 seconds), this is one of the longest videos posted by
Unfavorable Semicircle. The visuals contain a flickering series of
monochrome frames.

The audio is a mono track with a variety of data transmission type
sounds throughout.

## Audio analysis

The audio is a mono track with heavily-distorted spoken words. It is
difficult to confirm if it is the [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") or not.

Discord user ErasablePotato has observed the words sound like the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet), as used
in
[HFGCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Global_Communications_System)
messages. (*[sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi6d7F0Z3I0)*)

The audio has a distorted [Handshake](Handshake "wikilink") at the start
and at the end. Discord user Risto has observed that that creates one
half of the "Pisces symbol" in the initial Handshake, and the other half
at the end:
